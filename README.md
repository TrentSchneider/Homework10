# Team Profile Generator

## Description

This is a JS CLI that demonstrates my ability with JS CLIs. The CLI creates a series of prompts to get basic profile information for team members and then generate a website based off of the information to generate a team profile webpage.

## Installation

This JS CLI uses Inquirer for prompts and Jest for testing.

These can be installed using the "npm i" command from the command line while within the directory as there is a package.json to facilitate acquiring each module.

## Usage

The usage case for this JS CLI is a quick and easy way to create a team profile html page by completing a few prompts to aquire each team member's info.

On startup, the user is prompted to select which employee type they wish to add to the page. After selecting the type, the user is prompted to input information specific to that employee type. After finishing the first employee, the user is prompted to either select another employee type, or to complete the page. Once all employee's are added and the user selects to complete the page, the page is created, the user is notified of the page's completion, and the html file is stored in the output folder for retrieval.
